# VGP230 Final Game

Welcome to **VGP230FinalGame** ‚Äì a project developed as the final assignment for the VGP230 course! This game was built using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), a simple and easy-to-use C/C++ library to enjoy videogames programming.

## üïπÔ∏è Game Overview

This project is a demonstration of concepts and skills learned throughout VGP230, including graphics, input handling, collision detection, and basic gameplay programming. Challenge yourself to achieve a high score and explore the code to see how classic gameplay mechanics are implemented from scratch!

## ‚ú® Features

- Built with **raylib** in C/C++
- Responsive player controls
- Score tracking and win/lose conditions
- Clean, readable code

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

- **raylib** (recommended version: 4.x)
- **C** (or C++ if applicable)
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/), or [MSVC](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/) (for compiling)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (optional, for build automation)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) installed on your system
