Welcome to **VGP230FinalGame** ‚Äì a project developed as the final assignment for the VGP230 course! This game was built using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), a simple and easy-to-use C/C++ library to enjoy videogames programming.

## üïπÔ∏è Game Overview

This project is a demonstration of concepts and skills learned throughout VGP230, including graphics, input handling, collision detection, and basic gameplay programming. Challenge yourself to achieve a high score and explore the code to see how classic gameplay mechanics are implemented from scratch!

## ‚ú® Features

- Built with **raylib** in C/C++
- Custom graphics and animations
- Responsive player controls
- Score tracking and win/lose conditions
- Sound effects and background music
- Clean, readable code with comments

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With
